    <p>Energy Saving is a game that aims the robot to finish the course as fast as possible using solar energy. Only solar energy and condenser is allowed as a power, and since diverse courses (curved, straight, slope courses) are asked to be driven, understandings of structure of robot and physical knowledge is needed.</p>

    <p>In conventional robotics, the technological research focuses on strength and functionality of robots. Recently, out of these perspective, soft robot, which is new shape of robots inspired from biological systems attracts intensive interest in fields of robotics. Inspired from nature, we could improve the mechanical properties of conventional robots and impart new kinds of biological functions to robots. Many innovative strategies have been developed in recent years to design soft components and systems that realizes natural actuations of bioinspired robot. Soft robots consist of soft materials and are actuated by various kinds of mechanical principles. There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interactions, adaptive conformability to wearable devices, useful biological properties from organism etc. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. The purpose of this study is investigation of state of art technologies regarding mechanical and material aspects of soft robots. This review was written in three fundamental sections: i) Materials for soft robotics, ii) fundamental mechanics of soft materials and, iii) mechanical principles of actuation. The promising soft materials can be categorized simply in four types according to softness and functions: hydrogel, elastomer, shape memory polymer and self-healing polymer. These materials have softness and deformation freedom, which has potential to provide natural movements of robot enabling imitation of biological movements. To analyze it in scientific method, we investigate the several mechanical standards and principles of robot actuation in mechanical aspects. In the future, all robots would evolve closer to biological lives. </p>

    <img src="img/usaco.png" alt="">
     <p>Participants of the USA Computing Olympiad start from the Bronze division; by solving three questions dedicated to the division, one can move up a division. Out of 9,933 participants, only 774 were able to get to the Gold division for the past year.By utilizing online training resources like codeforces or past USACO problems, I was able to grasp a variety of tactics to solve algorithmic problems. Through constant 2 hour practices for three months, I was able to rank 138th place out of 774 pre-college participants that were competing in the Gold division.</p>
